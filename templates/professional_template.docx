[This will be a professionally formatted Word document with:
- Company header with logo placeholder
- Footer with page numbers
- Defined styles for titles, headings, body text
- Proper margins (2.5cm on all sides)
- Signature blocks
- Page break before signature section]

But since we can't actually create a .docx file via text, we'll instead create a Python script that generates the template programmatically. This approach gives us more control over the formatting.
